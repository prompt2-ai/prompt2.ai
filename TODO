To optimize efficiency, a cache system can be implemented for similar prompts. For instance, questions like "What is the capital of Greece?", "Tell me the name of the capital of Greece?", and "What The capital of Greece is?" should be recognized as having the same intent. The system can store the answer to the first query and retrieve it for subsequent similar queries, reducing the workload on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. That can be implemented by convert the prompt to a canonical form, which is a normalized version of the prompt. The canonical form of the prompt can be used as a key to store the answer in the cache. The cache can be implemented as a dictionary where the key is the canonical form of the prompt and the value is the answer. The cache will be stored  in a database. The cache can be updated periodically to remove old entries and free up memory. The cache can also be implemented as a distributed cache, to improve scalability and reduce latency.
